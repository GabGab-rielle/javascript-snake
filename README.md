# Nokia3310-Snake

I coded along with [Ania Kub√≥w](https://github.com/kubowania) on a vanilla JavaScript grid-based Snake game.

For the full walkthrough to coding the game, please visit [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWPGz9hrVMk)

In this tutorial I learnt how to make a fully functional game of Nokia 3310 Snake. I covered the following:

* project set up
* linking your JavaScript and CSS files to your HTML file
* event listeners
* query Selectors
* arrow functions
* forEach
* setting time intervals and countdowns
